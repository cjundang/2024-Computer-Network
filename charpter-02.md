### IP Addressing

**IP addresses** are numerical identifiers assigned to devices on a network to enable communication. Every device connected to a network—whether local or on the internet—requires a unique IP address.

There are two main versions of IP addressing in use:

* **IPv4**: The most widely used version. It uses a 32-bit format, typically written in dotted decimal notation, such as `192.168.1.1`.
* **IPv6**: A newer format designed to address the limitations of IPv4, including address exhaustion. It uses 128 bits and is written in hexadecimal notation, such as `2001:db8::1`.

IP addresses are further categorized by their use and scope. Understanding these categories is essential when designing or troubleshooting a network:

| **Type**   | **Description**                                                                                                                        | **Example**  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Public IP  | Routable on the internet. Assigned by an ISP to allow access from outside the local network.                                           | 8.8.8.8      |
| Private IP | Used within local networks. Not routable on the internet. Reserved ranges include 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, and 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x. | 192.168.1.10 |
| APIPA      | Automatically assigned when no DHCP server is available. Used for limited local communication.                                         | 169.254.x.x  |
| Loopback   | Used to test the local TCP/IP stack. It refers to the host itself.                                                                     | 127.0.0.1    |

Understanding how these address types are used helps network administrators ensure proper configuration and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. For example, a device using an APIPA address cannot access the internet, indicating a problem with the DHCP service. A public IP address is necessary for external-facing services, while private IP addresses are ideal for internal communication within a LAN.

### Subnet Mask

A **subnet mask** is used in IP networking to divide an IP address into two parts: the **network portion** and the **host portion**.
The network portion identifies the specific subnet, while the host portion identifies individual devices (hosts) within that subnet. Subnetting allows networks to be logically segmented, improving organization, efficiency, and security.

Subnet masks work hand-in-hand with IP addresses to determine whether two devices are on the same local network or if communication must be routed through a gateway.

#### Classful IP Addressing

In early IP networking, IP addresses were assigned using the **classful system**, which divided address space into fixed blocks called classes. Each class had a default subnet mask and defined ranges for host allocation.

**Classful IP Address Ranges**

| **Class** | **Address Range**           | **Default Subnet Mask** | **Use**         |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| A         | 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255   | 255.0.0.0 (/8)          | Large networks  |
| B         | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 (/16)       | Medium networks |
| C         | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 (/24)     | Small networks  |
| D         | 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 | N/A                     | Multicast       |
| E         | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 | N/A                     | Reserved        |

While classful addressing helped organize early networks, it proved inefficient due to its fixed subnet sizes, often resulting in wasted addresses.

#### Classless IP Addressing (CIDR)

Modern networks use **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**, which enables more flexible division of IP address space.
CIDR uses a suffix (slash notation) to indicate the number of bits used for the network portion.
For example, `192.168.1.0/24` means the first 24 bits define the network.

This approach facilitates more efficient subnetting and aggregation, known as route summarization, which is particularly important for Internet routing and enterprise networks.

| **Subnet Mask** | **CIDR Notation** | **Usable Hosts** |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------: |
| 255.255.255.0   | /24               |              254 |
| 255.255.255.192 | /26               |               62 |
| 255.255.255.255 | /32               |                1 |

In subnetting:

* A **/24** subnet provides 256 total IP addresses (2<sup>8</sup>), with 254 usable for hosts.
* A **/26** subnet provides 64 total addresses (2<sup>6</sup>), with 62 usable.
* A **/32** represents a single host, commonly used for loopbacks or static routes.

Understanding both classful and classless addressing is essential for interpreting legacy documentation, designing scalable networks, and passing exams such as the **CompTIA Network+** and **Cisco CCNA**.

### Default Gateway

The **default gateway** is a network device—typically a router—that acts as an access point or IP router allowing a host to send data to destinations outside its local subnet. When a device determines that the destination IP address is not within its network, it forwards the packet to the default gateway for routing.

This is especially important for accessing external networks, such as the internet or other remote subnets, within an enterprise environment. The gateway then handles the task of routing the data toward its final destination.

#### Example Scenario

Consider a PC configured with the following:

* IP Address: `192.168.1.100`
* Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
* Default Gateway: `192.168.1.1`

With this configuration, the PC identifies its local network as `192.168.1.0/24`. If the user attempts to access a website such as `www.example.com`, which resolves to an external IP like `93.184.216.34`, the destination is outside the local subnet. Therefore, the packet is sent to the **default gateway** at `192.168.1.1`, which routes the traffic toward the internet.

#### Gateway in Practice

In most home and office networks, the router performing Network Address Translation (NAT) also acts as the default gateway. Devices receive this information either through manual configuration or dynamically via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

#### Command-line Tip

On a Windows system, you can use the command `ipconfig` to verify the current default gateway:

> `Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1`

Correct configuration of the default gateway is essential. If it is missing or incorrectly set, the device will be unable to reach external networks, even if local communication is functioning correctly.

### DNS (Domain Name System)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a fundamental service that resolves human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. Without DNS, users would need to remember IP addresses (such as `142.250.190.14`) to visit websites like `www.google.com`. DNS automates this translation, allowing for user-friendly internet navigation.

When a user enters a domain name into a web browser, the operating system queries a configured DNS server. If the server knows the IP address associated with the domain, it returns the result; otherwise, it forwards the request to other DNS servers until a response is received.

#### Common DNS Record Types

| **Record Type** | **Purpose**                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**           | Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address (e.g., `example.com` → `93.184.216.34`)                   |
| **AAAA**        | Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address                                                           |
| **CNAME**       | Creates an alias that maps one domain name to another (e.g., `www.example.com` → `example.com`) |
| **MX**          | Defines the mail exchange server responsible for receiving emails for the domain                |

#### Example Scenario

If a user types `www.example.com` into a browser:

1. The computer sends a DNS query to the DNS server (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).
2. The DNS server replies with the corresponding IP address, such as `93.184.216.34`.
3. The browser then connects to this IP address to load the website.

#### Importance for Networking

DNS is a crucial component of the Internet's infrastructure. Incorrect or missing DNS settings can lead to errors like “server not found,” even if internet connectivity is otherwise functional. DNS is typically configured manually or received automatically via DHCP.

#### Command-line Tip

To troubleshoot DNS issues, use the following command:

> `nslookup www.example.com`

This command queries the DNS server and returns the resolved IP address, helping confirm whether name resolution is working correctly.

## Understanding a Basic IP Network

Before diving into complex enterprise networking, it's essential to understand how a basic network enables communication between a device and the internet. Small networks—such as those in homes, classrooms, or small offices—rely on fundamental networking components to provide reliable access. These components include an **IP address**, **subnet mask**, **default gateway**, and **DNS server**. The following diagram illustrates a simple network architecture involving a single client PC, a wireless router acting as both a gateway and a DHCP server, and a public DNS server. This setup serves as a practical example of how these components interact in real-world networking environments.

```latex
% TikZ diagram (original LaTeX)
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm, every node/.style={draw, align=center, font=\small}]

\node (pc) {Client PC\\IP: 192.168.1.10\\Subnet: 255.255.255.0\\GW: 192.168.1.1\\DNS: 8.8.8.8};
\node[right=of pc] (router) {Wireless Router\\IP: 192.168.1.1\\DHCP/DNS Relay\\NAT to Internet};

\draw[->] (pc) -- (router) node[midway, above] {LAN};
\draw[->] (router) -- (dns) node[midway, above] {Internet};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In a basic network setup, such as those found in homes, classrooms, or small offices, each device must be configured with several essential network parameters to communicate effectively within the local network and with the internet. These parameters include an **IP address**, **subnet mask**, **default gateway**, and **DNS server**. The **IP address** uniquely identifies the device on the network, while the **subnet mask** determines which portion of the IP address represents the network and which part designates the host. For example, a client computer might have an IP address of `192.168.1.10` with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`, placing it within the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet.

The **default gateway**, often the IP address of the local router (e.g., `192.168.1.1`), serves as the device's route to external networks. When the computer wants to communicate with devices outside its local subnet, such as a website on the internet, it sends the traffic to this gateway, which then forwards it appropriately. Additionally, the **DNS (Domain Name System)** server, such as Google's public DNS at `8.8.8.8`, resolves human-readable domain names like `www.example.com` into IP addresses that computers can understand. If DNS is not correctly configured, users may still have internet access but be unable to visit websites by name.

In this architecture, the router may also serve as a **DHCP server**, automatically assigning IP addresses and other settings to devices on the network. This essential yet straightforward configuration demonstrates how four key elements—**IP address**, **subnet mask**, **gateway**, and **DNS**—work together to enable seamless communication from a local device to resources across the globe. Understanding these components is crucial for network troubleshooting and is a foundational skill tested in certifications like **CompTIA Network+** and **Cisco CCNA**.

## Common Network Command-Line Tools

Several command-line tools are invaluable for diagnosing network issues by providing information related to different layers of the OSI model. Here are some simple and commonly used commands in both MS Windows and Linux:

* **`ipconfig`**: Displays the current TCP/IP network configuration of a host, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers (Layer 3). The `/all` switch provides more detailed information.

  ```bash
  ipconfig
  ipconfig /all
  ```

* **`ping`**: Sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests to a target host and listens for responses. It's used to test basic IP connectivity (Layer 3).

  ```bash
  ping <destination_ip_or_hostname>
  ```

* **`tracert`** (**`traceroute`** in Linux): Traces the path taken by packets to a destination host, displaying each hop (router) along the way. It helps identify routing issues (Layer 3).

  ```bash
  tracert <destination_ip_or_hostname>
  ```

* **`netstat`**: Displays active TCP connections, listening ports, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPv4 statistics (for IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols), IPv6 statistics (for IPv6, ICMPv6, TCP over IPv6, and UDP over IPv6), and network interface statistics (Layer 3 and 4).

  ```bash
  netstat -ano
  ```

* **`nslookup`**: Queries DNS (Domain Name System) servers to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa (Layer 7, relies on lower layers).

  ```bash
  nslookup <hostname_or_ip_address>
  ```

#### Common Connectivity Issues

| **Symptom**    | **Cause**                | **Solution**                |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| No internet    | Wrong gateway            | Update gateway IP           |
| DNS fails      | Misconfigured DNS server | Use public DNS like 8.8.8.8 |
| IP conflict    | Duplicate static IP      | Change IP or use DHCP       |
| APIPA assigned | DHCP server unreachable  | Check server and cabling    |

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

The **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP configuration information to devices (hosts) on a network. DHCP eliminates the need for manual configuration and ensures consistency across a network, especially in environments with many devices.

#### Purpose of DHCP

DHCP significantly reduces configuration errors and administrative overhead by dynamically providing the following key network settings to clients:

* **IP Address**
* **Subnet Mask**
* **Default Gateway**
* **DNS Server(s)**

Without DHCP, each host would need to be configured manually, which increases the risk of errors such as IP address conflicts, incorrect subnetting, or invalid gateways.

#### DHCP Operation — The DORA Process

When a DHCP-enabled device connects to a network, it follows a standardized four-step process to obtain its configuration. This sequence is often remembered by the acronym **DORA**:

1. **Discover** – The client broadcasts a DHCP Discover packet to locate available DHCP servers on the network.
2. **Offer** – A DHCP server replies with a DHCP Offer packet containing an available IP address and configuration options.
3. **Request** – The client responds with a DHCP Request packet, indicating acceptance of the offered configuration.
4. **Acknowledge** – The server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK) to finalize the lease, confirming the IP address assignment.

#### Lease Duration and Renewal

DHCP assigns IP addresses on a **lease** basis, meaning the assignment is temporary.
Clients must renew their leases periodically. This allows networks to recycle IP addresses as devices connect and disconnect efficiently.

#### DHCP in Practice

In a typical home or small office setup, the wireless router acts as the DHCP server. In enterprise environments, DHCP servers are typically centralized and often utilize relay agents to service clients across different subnets.

#### Command-line Tip

On Windows, the following commands can be used to manage and troubleshoot DHCP:

```bash
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```
